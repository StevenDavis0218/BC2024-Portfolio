            Hello, I am a 15 year old sophmore at Martinsville High School. Who is interested in the tech field. I am not sure exactly which path I wanna take in the tech industry, but probally a software developer, or Help Desk Technician. I have a lot of hobbies that I indulge on in my freetime. These hobbies include lifting, Basketball, Swimming, Gaming, and boxing(I suck).

            This is the first website I ever made. It is a website that is based on how bad the NBA refs have been recently. It took a pretty lengthy amount time, about 2 days. It was my first website so keep in mind it is scuffed.

        This is my second website it is a choose your own adventure. It has 4 possible outcomes, and it is a story that starts in the woods and you have an option to go into the woods or go home. If you choose to go into the woods you will get faced with a monster. If you drive home you get faced with someone that is in the road.

            This website was my third ever and it was a quiz that was named "Which food are you" and it would tell you which food you were based on wha you picked.
